## Introduction

This project was an excersize in understanding RenderMan's Interface Bytstream Protocol (RIB) along with Open Shading Language (OSL).
For background RIB is a scene description format for Pixar's RenderMan render engine. While different in purpose, similarities can be seen between RIB and the newer Open USD format, which makes sense seeing as they're both developed by the same company.
OSL is an open source shading language for PBR rendering engines targeting high end VFX.
